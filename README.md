# Jetstream observer

This is a small F# prototype to wrap out the [Jetstream](https://github.com/bluesky-social/jetstream) project from the bluesky folks.

Jetstream provides realtime updates over the bluesky network

Once I'm kind of finished with this, I'm almost sure I will try to publish a few things here and there as NuGet packages so others can interact relatively easy with bluesky.
